Got it ✅ Since this is for your AI Document Summarizer project, I’ll draft a professional README.md that explains setup, usage, and deployment. You can copy it directly into your project folder.

Here’s the first version:

📄 AI Document Summarizer & Q&A System

An AI-powered tool that summarizes documents and answers questions from uploaded files (PDF, Word). The system uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), LangChain, and Ollama for efficient summarization and context-based question answering.

🚀 Features

📚 Document Upload: Supports PDF and Word files.

✂️ Chunking: Splits long documents into manageable sections for efficient processing.

🤖 Summarization: Generates concise summaries of uploaded documents.

❓ Question Answering: Lets you ask questions and receive context-aware answers.

🛡 Prompt Safety: Guardrails to prevent prompt injection/jailbreak attempts.

⚡ Fast & Cost-Efficient: Runs locally with free tools (Ollama, LangChain).

📦 Dockerized Environment: Easy deployment with pre-configured dependencies.

🛠 Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI

AI Frameworks: LangChain, Ollama

RAG: Vector database integration for retrieval

Containerization: Docker

Frontend/Hosting: Vercel / Netlify (optional)


⚙️ Installation
1. Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/summrizer.git
cd summrizer

2. Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run with Docker (Optional)
docker build -t project-2 .
docker run -p 8000:8000 project-2

▶️ Usage
Start Backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

API Endpoints

POST /upload → Upload document (PDF/Word)

POST /summarize → Get summary of uploaded document

POST /ask → Ask a question related to the document

🌐 Deployment

Local: Run with uvicorn or Docker.

Cloud: Deploy via Vercel or Netlify (frontend) + Render/Heroku (backend).

🛡 Security Notes

Guardrails are in place against prompt injection.

Only supports safe document parsing (PDF, DOCX).

No external API costs — everything runs locally with Ollama.

📌 Future Improvements

Add support for multiple documents at once.

Improve summarization granularity (paragraph-level, section-level).

Add UI with drag-and-drop file upload.
